# Trustworthiness Detector: Implementation & Usage Guide

## Example Usage

Before diving into the implementation details, here's a quick example of how to use the library:

```python
from trustworthiness import TrustworthinessDetector

# Initialize with default settings
detector = TrustworthinessDetector()

# Evaluate a single Q&A pair
question = "What is the capital of France?"
answer = "Paris"
score = detector.evaluate(question, answer)
print(f"Trust score: {score:.2f}")
```

For a more comprehensive example, see [examples/usage_example.py](examples/usage_example.py) which demonstrates:
- Batch processing of multiple Q&A pairs
- Custom scoring functions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Real-world integration patterns

## Development Journey

  - Performed final code review and optimizations

## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through a more complex example showing how to use the library in a real-world scenario:

```python
from trustworthiness import TrustworthinessDetector, BatchEvaluationRequest

# Initialize with custom settings
detector = TrustworthinessDetector(
    temperature=0.0,  # More deterministic responses
    max_retries=3,    # Retry failed requests
    cache_responses=True  # Cache API responses
)

# Prepare batch evaluation
requests = [
    {"question": "What is 1 + 1?", "answer": "2"},
    {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "answer": "Paris"},
    {"question": "How many planets are in our solar system?", "answer": "Eight"}
]

# Evaluate batch
results = detector.evaluate_batch(requests)

# Process results
for result in results:
    status = "✅" if result.trust_score.score >= 0.7 else "❌"
    print(f"{status} Q: {result.question}")
    print(f"   A: {result.answer}")
    print(f"   Score: {result.trust_score.score:.2f}")
    print(f"   Confidence: {result.trust_score.explanation.confidence:.0%}")
```

## Development Toolkit

### Tools That Made My Life Easier
- **VS Code**: My trusty code editor with Python and Docker extensions that I use for everything
- **GitHub Copilot**: My AI pair programmer that helped me write boilerplate code and docstrings
- **Claude AI**: Helped me understand the nuances of the BSDetector algorithm and edge cases
- **Git/GitHub**: My go-to for version control and project management
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Made local development and deployment a breeze
- **Make**: Saved me from remembering long commands
- **pre-commit hooks**: Kept my code clean and consistent

### Python Libraries I Relied On
- **FastAPI**: Chose this for its speed and automatic docs
- **pydantic**: Made data validation a pleasure to work with
- **python-dotenv**: Kept my secrets out of the code
- **pytest**: My testing framework of choice
- **black & isort**: Because consistent formatting matters
- **mypy**: Helped catch type-related bugs early
- **ruff**: Made linting fast and painless
- **httpx**: For making async HTTP requests
- **prometheus-client**: Added monitoring with minimal effort
- **loguru**: Made logging beautiful and useful

### Why I Chose Not to Use litellm
Initially, I considered using litellm as suggested in the assignment, but after careful consideration, I decided against it for several reasons:

1. **Dependency Management**: I wanted to keep the project lightweight and avoid pulling in additional dependencies that weren't strictly necessary. Since I was focusing on Gemini API initially, I chose to implement the client directly.

2. **Learning Opportunity**: Implementing the API client myself gave me a deeper understanding of how to work with the Gemini API directly, which I believe is valuable knowledge.

3. **Control Over Error Handling**: I wanted fine-grained control over error handling and retry logic, which is sometimes abstracted away in higher-level libraries.

4. **Simpler Debugging**: Fewer layers of abstraction make it easier to debug issues when they arise.

5. **Performance**: Direct API calls can sometimes be more efficient than going through an additional abstraction layer.

That said, I designed the code to be modular, so adding support for litellm or other providers in the future would be straightforward if needed.

## My Design Philosophy

### 1. Focused Implementation Scope
I decided to focus on implementing just the self-reflection certainty algorithm from Section 3.2 of the BSDetector paper. While the full BSDetector includes additional components like cross-verification, I believed that perfecting this core functionality would deliver the most value within the given timeframe. I made sure to design the code in a way that makes it easy to add the other components later if needed.
